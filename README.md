# openscad-template
A template for development using OpenSCAD in Codespaces.

## Getting started

1. Create a codespace in this repository and open it in Visual Studio Code
2. View the virtual desktop in your browser at http://localhost:6080
3. Sign in with password `vscode`
4. Back in VSCode, open `box.scad` and press the "Preview in OpenSCAD" button in the top-right (the icon is a box with a double-right-facing-chevron)'
5. The OpenSCAD window should appear on the virtual desktop in your browser. Editing `box.scad` in VSCode will automatically update the file in the OpenSCAD application.
